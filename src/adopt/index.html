        <h1>Please consider adopting a cat</h1>
        <p>
          There are many reasons a cat may find itself without a home, maybe
          they were born to a feral mom and taught to mistrust humans, hunt and
          survive. Perhaps they were put outside when the owner decided that
          having a cat was not in their best interest and left to fend for
          themselves finding out quickly that resources are limited, elements
          are cruel and not all people are kind. Possibly they were taken for a
          drive and dumped in an environment that is new, scary and unfriendly
          having to nowhere to go to with limited skills to survive. Then of
          course there are those who flee in fear from cruelty and abuse. Many
          people have the idea that cats can survive on their own and although
          that may be true of feral cats for a short while this is not true for
          a great majority of cats out there. The realty is an outdoor cat lives
          1 to 5 years, less if they have been abandoned. They are subject to
          disease, illness, starvation, the elements, parasites, other animals
          or people harming them or getting run over by cars.
